##Special Thanks:
- *BullShark* - for ideas, showing me buttbot, and the name 'buttbutt'
- *Klong* - for tons of contributions and several commits
- *ebolahats* - for being a rubber duck
- *MandL27* - for breaking the bot and pointing out what's annoying

##Usage:
TODO!  The bot is usable, and as it gets more stable I will develop help
documentation and help functions.  As of right now, it's too dynamic.
We decide to change major features every other week it seems.
